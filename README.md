# EmployeeManagementSystem

The **EmployeeManagementSystem** project is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee records efficiently. It consists of two modules: **ems-frontend** and **ems-backend**, each playing a specific role in the system.

---

## Project Structure
- **Frontend Module**: `ems-frontend` (developed using React.js with Vite.js)
- **Backend Module**: `ems-backend` (developed using Spring Boot with MySQL database)

---

## Frontend (`ems-frontend`)
The frontend of the application is built with **React.js**, leveraging the **Vite.js** tool for fast builds and optimized development.

### Key Features and Technologies Used
1. **Vite.js**:
   - A fast build tool that simplifies and speeds up the development of React projects.
   - Provides an optimized development environment with live reloading.

2. **React Features**:
   - `useState`:
     - A hook used to manage local component state in a functional component.
     - Example: To manage form inputs or toggle UI elements.
   - `useEffect`:
     - A hook used to perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
     - Example: Fetch employee data from the backend when the component loads.
   - `useNavigate` and `useParams` (from `react-router-dom`):
     - `useNavigate` allows navigation between different routes programmatically.
     - `useParams` is used to extract route parameters (e.g., employee ID) from the URL.
   - **React Router**:
     - `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Routes` are used to manage client-side routing.
     - Enables navigation without reloading the entire application.

3. **Axios**:
   - A popular HTTP client library used to send API requests from the frontend to the backend.
   - Example: Sending a POST request to create a new employee record or a GET request to retrieve data.

---

## Backend (`ems-backend`)
The backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, utilizing **MySQL** as the database to store and manage employee data.

### Key Annotations Used
1. **@CrossOrigin**:
   - Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow the frontend (running on a different port) to communicate with the backend.
   - Example: Allowing the React frontend (localhost:3000) to access the Spring Boot API (localhost:8080).

2. **@RestController**:
   - Marks the class as a controller where every method returns a response body.
   - Handles incoming HTTP requests and sends responses in JSON format.

3. **@RequestMapping**:
   - Maps HTTP requests to handler methods of the controller.
   - Example: Set the base URL for APIs like `/api/employees`.

4. **@AllArgsConstructor**:
   - Automatically generates a constructor with arguments for all fields in the class.
   - Simplifies dependency injection in Spring Boot.

5. **HTTP Method Annotations**:
   - **@PostMapping**: Handles `POST` requests (e.g., adding a new employee).
   - **@GetMapping**: Handles `GET` requests (e.g., retrieving employee data).
   - **@PutMapping**: Handles `PUT` requests (e.g., updating employee data).
   - **@DeleteMapping**: Handles `DELETE` requests (e.g., deleting employee data).

6. **JPA Annotations**:
   - **@Entity**:
     - Marks a class as a JPA entity, mapping it to a database table.
     - Example: The `Employee` class is mapped to the `employee` table in MySQL.
   - **@Table(name = "employee")**:
     - Specifies the table name for the entity in the database.
   - **@Id**:
     - Marks a field as the primary key.
   - **@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)**:
     - Specifies that the primary key value is auto-generated by the database.

7. **Lombok Annotations**:
   - **@Getter** and **@Setter**:
     - Automatically generate getter and setter methods for the fields in the class.
   - **@NoArgsConstructor**:
     - Generates a no-arguments constructor for the class.

8. **@Override**:
   - Used to indicate that a method is overriding a method from its superclass or interface.

## Database
The application uses **MySQL** as the database. The `employee` table stores the employee details, such as:

- Employee ID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Department
- Email
- Salary

## How to Run the Application
### Prerequisites
1. Install **Node.js** and **npm** (for the frontend).
2. Install **Java 21** and **Maven** (for the backend).
3. Install **MySQL** and configure the database.

### Steps to Run
1. **Backend**:
   - Navigate to the `ems-backend` folder.
   - Update `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials.
   - Run the application using:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

2. **Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `ems-frontend` folder.
   - Install dependencies using:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

3. Open the application in your browser:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:8080`
